GrindAI is a research project combining adaptive machine learning with physics-informed modeling for grinding process optimization. This repository provides ML models (XGBoost, GPR, SVR) for surface roughness prediction in CNC grinding using 20 kHz force signals, with feature extraction, models, results, and visualizations.

Ra_Roughness_extraction.ipynb contains code for the mesured roughness values Ra, Rq, Rz from the pdf files.
Ra_Prediction_Models.ipynb contains the complete pipeline for data loading, analysis, filtering, and machine learning model development.
