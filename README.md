# GrindAI
GrindAI is a research project combining adaptive machine learning with physics-informed modeling for grinding process optimization. This repository provides ML models (XGBoost, GPR, SVR) for surface roughness prediction in CNC grinding using 20 kHz force signals, with feature extraction, models, results, and visualizations.
